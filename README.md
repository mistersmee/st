# My build of st
The following patches have been added (found in the patches folder)
+ alpha
+ anysize
+ bold-is-not-bright
+ boxdraw_v2
+ externalpipe
+ externalpipe-eternal
+ font2
+ iso14755
+ ligatures
+ scrollback
+ scrollback-mouse
+ scrollback-mouse-altscreen
+ vertcenter
+ xresources
+ xclearwin
+ clipboard
+ OSC 10 11 12 2

Keybindings have also been customised to my tastes (i.e stolen from Luke Smith's build. I used that for so long, I'm most comfortable with them.). Checkout config.def.h for more.

Also, some code from Luke Smith's build has been proudly lifted, to fix some bugs i.e, the alpha patch not being correctly fully transparent, and the correct defaultbg, etc values, and the externalpipe scripts are also lifted from the same.

st version 0.8.4.

st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
